/*
  Close your eyes! This file's contents are not meant to be seen!
  Why? Because they contain SECRETS. Those that Julian Assange must
  not be able to get hold of. How secret are these secrets? Well,
  they're encrypted with the most highest ROT-13 level encryption,
  far superior than AES-256 in resisting cryptanalysis. The insane
  degree of encryption should make this technology the basis of 
  twenty third century digital rights management algorithms, as they
  can not possibly be broken by even the most skilled hackers!
  
  This is really just an excessively complex way of obscuring
  the keys so search engines or other stuff can't find it. And
  that whenever some company has it in their terms of service,
  they can't find that I'm violating their obvious rules.
  
  Actually, this isn't a cipher at all. There's really no encryption
  but that makes sense as, like all forms of DRM, this depends on
  the secrecy of the decryption routines. So I won't tell you that
  it's based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and some random string
  splitting and reversing.
  
  The encoder functions are inside my dropbox folder where there's a
  neatly decoded source version that generates whatever goes into this 
  file.
